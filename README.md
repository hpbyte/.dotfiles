# Install Stow

[Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is a symlink farm manager which will be the key to the setup cuz it will link the config files to the place where they need to be (usually under $HOME)

```
brew install stow
```

# Install the configs

```
./install
```

# Clearing all the configs

```
./clean
```
